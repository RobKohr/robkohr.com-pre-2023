                    <p>If you have a site that you want to attract a lot of people to, one way is to translate the site into every language under the sun. This makes it so someone speaking some other language types in a few keywords in their native language will hit your site. Being most of the web is in english, this makes for some easy high ranking results in google.Â </p>
<p>How to do it:</p>
<ol><li>Wrap any piece of text in your html like so &lt;?=t(&lsquo;Some text)?&gt;</li>
<li>create a function called t which will either:   
<ul><li>pull from the db the translation of your text (if it exists)</li>
<li>pull the translation from google translate api and store/return it: <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/language/translate/overview.html">http://code.google.com/apis/language/translate/overview.html</a> </li>
</ul></li>
<li>create some url pattern that will be used to identify the language. This could be either a sub-domain or a part of the uri</li>
<li>profit?</li>
</ol>
