                                    <h1>Reduce carbon in the atmosphere - chop down a tree</h1>
                    <p>As a tree grows it captures carbon. Most of a tree is made of carbon. Once a tree reaches its full growth potential, it doesn&rsquo;t work very well as a carbon sink, and if it dies and decays, that carbon is released again.</p>
<p>When you chop down a tree, and turn it into paper or lumber so it can&rsquo;t rot as easily, that carbon becomes more effectively stored. You could even bury it deep in the earth so a million years from now, our decendends can have cheap petrol to burn.</p>
<p>The important thing is that when you chop down the tree, you need to plant another. Then the same piece of land can sequester more carbon.</p>
<p>This would mean that the tree farming operations where the same forest is being cut down and regrown year after year make for one of the most effective way to reduce the carbon in the atmosphere.</p>
