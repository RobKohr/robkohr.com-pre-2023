<p>FREAKING AWESOME!!</p>
<p>Shooting Pool on a Virtual Surface!</p>
<p>Found in Esquireâ€™s Ultimate Bachelor Pad in Soho, New York, the Obscura CueLight uses a series of sensors and an overhead projector to cast images on a pool table that follow the balls around as you play. The $80,000 system (not including the table) is set up so that balls reveal a hidden image on the table, and when moving around, are traced by flames or water ripples on a liquid surface.<br/><br/> Although this technology currently has no practical purpose, the creators are working on a program that would give beginners visual cues on where to hit the ball to make the perfect shot. Check out the video below to see it in action.</p>
