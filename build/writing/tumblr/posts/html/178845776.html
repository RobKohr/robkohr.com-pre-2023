                                    My father says almost the whole world&amp;rsquo;s asleep. Everybody you know, everybody you see, everybody you talk to.  He says only a few people are awake.   And they live in a state of constant total amazement.                    <div class="caption">&mdash; Patricia from Joe Vs The Volcano</div>
