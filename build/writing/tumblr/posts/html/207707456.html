                                    <h1>Podcast most recent playlist</h1>
                    <p><b>The Problem</b></p>
<p>I use an iPhone as really an iTouch (I dislike ATT) that is used mostly to listen to podcasts in the car. One problem I have with the way podcasts are handled in the iphone is that they are all in what amounts to separate playlists, so you need to do a lot of navigation to jump to each of your newest podcasts. Not a good thing when you are driving on the highway.</p>
<p><b>The Goal</b></p>
<p>Ideally, I just want to press play, and start driving, and have the ipod play the newest unplayed podcasts.</p>
<p>The trick, set up an automated playlist in itunes, and have the ipod synch to that. When I am on the road, I go to that playlist, hit play, and I am done.</p>
<p><b>Steps to set up</b></p>
<ol><li>Open itunes</li>
<li>File-&gt;new smart playlist</li>
<li>Call it something like &ldquo;New Podcasts&rdquo;</li>
<li>Use the following settings: <br/><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_kr7jt3Mp781qzjh7o.png"/></li>
<li>Save</li>
<li>click on your ipod/iphone</li>
<li>Click on the &ldquo;music&rdquo; tab (not the podcasts one)</li>
<li>Add the smart playlist you created</li>
<li>sync&hellip; and you are done</li>
</ol><p>In the ipod itself, you just go to the playlist, and it will have the newest stuff in it.</p>
<p>I set my time limit on the smart playlist to 7 hours, as this is how much I expect to listen to my ipod between syncs (7 days of 1 hour commutes).</p>
