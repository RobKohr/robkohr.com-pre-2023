                                    <h1>How to fix healthcare -> Market Based Socialism</h1>
                    <p>The US spends about 16% of its GDP on healthcare and Europe spends 9%. (<a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2009/08/27/healthCareInANutshell.html?dsq=16222306#comment-16222306">Source</a>)</p>
<p>The GDP is 13.84 Trillion<br/>Lets say we want to spend what europe spends, 9% = 1.07 Trillion<br/>That would be $3847 per person per year (304,059,724 people). <br/><br/>Lets just write a check to every single us citizen for that much, but make it payable only to a health insurance provider of their choice. Insurance companies can not discriminate based on the health or other features of the customer. They offer features, and a price, and the consumer buys or not. <br/><br/>Whatever consumers don&rsquo;t spend, they get to keep a third of, the rest goes back into the system. <br/><br/>Remove the requirement for employers to pay health care, I think that leads to poor results since the costs are hidden from the customers (the employees). It also makes non-employees compete with employers with deep pockets for insurance plans. This is a major reason that buying your own personal insurance is so expensive. <br/><br/>Tax the entire population based upon a percentage of income, to achieve the amount of cash needed for this program. <br/><br/>The whole system becomes a simple accounting system, with no need for the govt to manage the actually health care insurance industry. Market economics take care of all the nasty details. <br/><br/>Other areas this could type of system could apply to:</p>
<ul><li>Education</li>
<li>Mass transit tickets (could encourage the private development of mass transit)</li>
<li>Food</li>
<li>Home and rental support</li>
</ul><p>Not all of these would be useful or necessary, but it is a way of clearing the burden of (mis)management from the shoulders of govt. It also makes it more apparent when you are taking from Peter to pay Paul, and could lead to a clearer reality of the govt intervention into the market. When choosing whether to have the govt build a giant workforce, or just cutting a check to citizens, the second seems more effective.</p>
<p>You should also not give to some of the population, but not to others. This leads to a strange cut off point where if you make a certain amount you lose benefits, and so you lose the reward for improving your financial position. An even percentage deduction from all, will pay all an equal dollar amount. That dollar amount can then be used only for those services that match the government determined need.</p>
<p>There are obvious areas that this wouldn&rsquo;t work:</p>
<ul><li>Building roads</li>
<li>The space program</li>
<li>The military</li>
<li>The legal system</li>
</ul><p>Because they benefit everyone equally whether you pay into them or not.</p>
