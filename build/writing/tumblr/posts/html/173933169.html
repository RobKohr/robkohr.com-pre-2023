                    <p>So as we point out telescopes out in the cosmos, looking for life, we use the earth we have as a model for that life. The interesting thing is the earth we currently have would be a horrible place to start life. The thick oceans, acid rain, and little oxygen are some of the things I think of when the first chemical elements that make up us started replicating. It probably looked a bit like this:</p>

<p>If all life were removed from the earth right now, life may never reappear here since the enviornment isn&rsquo;t ideal for it.</p>
<p>My guess is if you are looking for life, you want a highly chemically reactive enviornment.</p>
<p>This makes me think about the rise of the plants and the following rise of really big animals. Plants dominated the land at first and made an oxegen rich atmosphere. With so much oxegen, animal life was able to grow big, really big. What would have happened if plants existed, but no organisms existed to convert the oxygen into carbon dioxide. Would the plants kill themselves on their own emmisions?</p>
<p>If we kill ourselves and all animal life by pumping out too much CO2, would the plants compensate and grow larger, happy in this new world where they can breath easier?</p>
