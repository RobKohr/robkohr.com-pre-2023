Land was the basis of all taxes under the Georgist system, because if someone owned a lot of land, then they would be able to make a lot of money on it, and thus buy more of the land until only a few people owned everything. <br><br>A different take on it is to instead of taking taxes from rents, just charge property tax. <br><br>So these taxes would make it so those who owned significant amounts of land would then also have to contribute significant amounts back to the general public via taxes. <br><br>In many ways your local government works of the Georgist system. Property taxes pay for schools, local roads, police, etc. This leads to a positive feedback loop, where the more services a local govt provides, the more property values go up, and so the more money it gets in to provide more services. It is such an effective model, that we just take it for granted today.<br><br>Part of the Georgist theory was that income and sales tax puts friction in the system: paying someone or buying something has a transaction cost on top of it. Remove those transaction costs, and then you will have a healthier more productive economy. Rent charging isn&#39;t the same economic activity, and controlling an area and charging higher rents does not benefit most people.</span></div><div><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/117163681806482190070/posts/fkJvKcY3eCJ" class="reshare-attribution">Originally shared by Rafael “Francisco” Chandler</a>&quot;She created two sets of rules for her game: an anti-monopolist set in which all were rewarded when wealth was created, and a monopolist set in which the goal was to create monopolies and crush opponents. Her dualistic approach was a teaching tool meant to demonstrate that the first set of rules was morally superior. And yet it was the monopolist version of the game that caught on, with Darrow claiming a version of it as his own and selling it to Parker Brothers.&quot;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/business/behind-monopoly-an-inventor-who-didnt-pass-go.html?_r=1" target="_blank" class="link-embed"><h3>Monopoly’s Inventor: The Progressive Who Didn’t Pass ‘Go’ - NYTimes.com</h3><img src="http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/02/15/business/15-MONOPOLY-JP1/15-MONOPOLY-JP1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg" alt=""></a></div></div><span itemprop="audience"><div class="visibility">Shared with: Public</div></span></body></html>
