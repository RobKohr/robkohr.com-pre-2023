Anyone within this field would feel that they jumped forward in time in a flash. <br><br>Before long, the jumpBooth became a commercial product, retailing for a mere million dollars. NASA bought them with the idea of once again going to space and traveling longer distances without life support. People with terminal diseases bought them to perhaps jump to when they could be cured. Some people even got some money together to send a historian on a journey to tell the future what it was really like to live today. <br><br>The ones that bought them the most though, were investors. There was someone named Warren Buffet that just popped up ever 10 years, looked around made some quick transactions and moved on. Others joined the flow into the future looking for great gains over long term investment plans. This had the effect of slowing the growth of stocks and decreasing long term returns.<br><br>As the price fell for the jumpBooth, more people could use it. During wars the peace-nicks would jump forward looking for a more peaceful world. Without any movement to rally against the wars, the wars stretched on. <br><br>During a technological dark age where there were few advancements, the inventors and innovators began jumping and created a brain drain into the future. <br><br>Eventually everyone could jump, and did so frequently. The weather wasn&#39;t good, jump. A plague was breaking out, jump. Not enough people around due to all the jumping, jump.<br><br>The weeds began pushing up through the highways, and the wilderness reclaimed the cities. The environment changed to become more inhospitable to a species once known as man, who never had a chance to evolve to match it. Occasionally they would flash in for a moment here and there, but they just kept pushing forward, hoping for a better time and place for themselves that only they could create. <br><br>-Robert Kohr</span></div></div><span itemprop="audience"><div class="visibility">Shared with: Public, <a href="https://plus.google.com/103260735543144200422">Rusty Coomes</a></div></span><meta itemprop="commentCount" content="3"><div class="comments"><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+RustyCoomes" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Rusty Coomes</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2011-09-26T10:36:55-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">very cool idea. tell me, what do you think about whole body emulation/ augmentation?</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+RobKohr" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Rob Kohr</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2011-09-26T12:59:37-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text"><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/103260735543144200422" oid="103260735543144200422" >Rusty Coupmes</a></span> I think body augmentation (ala what you see in the new Deus Ex) is a pipe dream, mainly due to the energy requirements and power output. The human body is far more efficient at storing and converting energy to power than any machine. According to howstuffworks,  a human biker can achieve the equivalent of 912 miles on a gallon of gas.<br><br>Regarding brain emulation, I think that is possible. I mean if you can simulate all of the motion of particles that make up a brain, you would have a simulated brain that should be able to think. Check out a book called &quot;Permutation City&quot; which really explores this topic.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+RustyCoomes" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Rusty Coomes</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2011-09-26T13:11:15-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">thanks i will</div></div></div></body></html>
