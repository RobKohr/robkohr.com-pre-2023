(no bugs found)&quot;<br><br>Well, I tried.  If you&#39;re more comfortable believing that casual use should expose bugs, well, have fun.  Clearly that has gone well for other libraries, which is why after almost six years and under use by nearly half the web, jQuery is still turning up fundamental defects in its most commonly used code on a weekly basis.<br><br>Testing in the form of watching various people&#39;s production code blow up isn&#39;t testing.  You are recommending bad code which has never been verified or specified on grounds that you don&#39;t yet know what&#39;s wrong with it.<br><br>&quot;If you do see a problem, it looks like they are pretty good on integrating improvements.&quot;<br><br>I have better things to do than regression test other people&#39;s libraries for them.<br><br>&quot;What bugs have you seen?&quot;<br><br>I&#39;m not really interested in proving this.  It would take time for me to dig them up again, and of course, it&#39;s not my job to figure out whether the advice you&#39;re giving is harmful.<br><br>There&#39;s no shortage of examples on Google, and I found more than a dozen within my first hour of looking, the last time I looked.  Try a little property-based testing; it&#39;s really quite easy to do.<br><br>I just thought I would give you a heads up that it&#39;s approrpiate to research the quality of a library before recommending it to others, rather than to wait for someone to point out to you what you&#39;ve recommended, then to request that they do your research for you.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+RobKohr" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Rob Kohr</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2011-09-14T18:57:36-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">Well, they have test cases they run against, multiple authors that do bug fixing, and comments where people post fixes. They have a github repository as well, but it doesn&#39;t seem to have any active pushes from other users. <br><br>You don&#39;t need to prove to me that they have bugs, but I would expect if someone does find a bug they would report it and submit a fix. <br><br>As with any library that doesn&#39;t have a large install base (each function you pretty much use individually) you should be cautious, but the code is usually short and easy to noodle through the workings of. <br><br>I would still recommend it. It has saved me a huge amount of time over the last year or so, and probably reduced the risk of bugs that I would create in low level function coding. Something vetted by at least a community of developers is better off then a piece of quick hackery to meet a need. <br><br>You bring up jQuery as an example. Would you suggest someone do something other than use jQuery for their DOM/Javascript stuff?</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+JohnHaugeland" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">John Haugeland</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2011-09-14T19:35:42-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">Yeah.  Javascript.<br><br>It never ceases to amaze me how much time people say jQuery saves them, yet that they always seem to be stuck on jQuery bugs which would never occur in simple ECMA work, and they never actually have the kind of work accounting which would lead to their understanding whether something actually saved them time or not.<br><br>It&#39;s like benchmarking. You always think you know where the bottlenecks are going to be, then you actually measure it, and it turns out you were 100% wrong all along.<br><br>No.  jQuery does not save you time, and neither does this.  You will learn more and be better if you implement one of these yourself, and take the steps to make it correct and durable like these people did not.<br><br>There&#39;s a reason that people who use jQuery rarely make anything of actual complexity.  Same goes for all those other generic frameworks out there.<br><br>I use jQuery for stupid shit, like animation, but if you&#39;re using it for your actual infrastructure, You&#39;re Doing It Wrong (tm).</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+JohnHaugeland" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">John Haugeland</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2011-09-14T19:36:54-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">Try actually measuring a project done two different ways.  You&#39;re going to find that the pure ECMA implementation is about 120% the size, has about 15% the defects, and is done in half the time.<br><br>You just can&#39;t say whether it saves you time without measuring, Rob.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+RobKohr" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Rob Kohr</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2011-09-15T08:31:08-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">I don&#39;t know.
