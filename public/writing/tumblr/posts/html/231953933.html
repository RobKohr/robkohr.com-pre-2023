                                    <h1>US - The Saudi Arabia of Coal</h1>
                    <p>These are some random facts from an FT article I read today.</p>
<p>50% of electricity is produced from coal</p>
<p>Workers at the largest coal mine in the world (North Antelope Rochelle) work 12 hours shifts with microwaves, refridgerators, etc in the trucks to keep the operation going 24 hours a day without interruption. Every day 15,500 tones are loaded up on trains from that mine, and it supplies 40% of the US&rsquo;s coal needs.</p>
<p>This mine has roughly 100-150 years worth of production based on current output. The US is estimated to have several hundred years&rsquo; worth of coal to be recovered.</p>
<p>It is estimated that the US will emit 7,550m tons of CO2 a year by 2030, which is 14% more than 2005 levels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Barack Obama, president, from a coal-mining state of Illinois, backs continued coal use. He has said if the US can put a man on the moon, it can find a way to capture and store carbon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have my doubts that there is enough push to really make that a reality.</p>
<p>To put carbon capture on existing coal plants woudl push operating costs up by 80%. And as Paul Forester states &ldquo;If you push 20 years&rsquo; worth of CO2 in the ground and it leaks out, your back 30 years. We need it to stay there forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could imagine us going full on clean-carbon energy producing, just to have the carbon leach out over the next hundred years, and be worse off then we are.</p>
