                                    <h1>Why vinyl records</h1>
                    <p>I remember back when CDs came out, people tried to show whether they beat vinyl by using blind A/B tests. People either couldn&rsquo;t tell the difference or said the CD was higher quality. The public was sold, and CDs become the standard.</p>
<p>Now there is a rebirth of vinyl records, and some people wonder why.</p>
<p>The reason why is that the A/B test wasn&rsquo;t the test that measured people&rsquo;s appreciation for what they were listening. It wasn&rsquo;t the sound that was important. It is the experience of listening to the music on a CD, which feels cheap, mass produced, and less human.</p>

<p>The human ear can&rsquo;t tell the difference, but just like how the lighting in a room can effect a meal, playing a record can elicit a different experience. When it comes down to it, music is the experience, not the ability to differentiate sound quality.</p>

<p>Now that music is just a series of bits that you can buy from a virtual store, records seem real. They have a weight, a smell, and a quality that you can&rsquo;t compare to digital music, because digital music has none of those things. If CDs were cheap and mass produced, digital is potentially infinitely produced with zero cost, and potentially zero worth.</p>

<p>So should you switch to vinyl. If you asked me I would tell you absolutely not, as my opinion would matter just as little as that digital download. If you feel compelled to, if you feel a bit of nostalgia (even for a time you didn&rsquo;t live through), then stop reading now and go pick up a record player and a bunch of albums on the cheap. Because music is something not heard through your ears and bit rate isn&rsquo;t what makes it great. It is about the experience.</p>
