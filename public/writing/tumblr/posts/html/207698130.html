                    <p>Speedcrunch is a great calculator application that is available on all major OSes</p>
<p><img src="http://speedcrunch.org/images/kde-all_small.png"/></p>
<p>It works very much like a scientific calculator, with variables and complex expressions. It also gives you updates to the calculation as you are typing.</p>
<p>Though it is seems complex, it is my favorite to use even for the most basic of calculations. It is fast and the interface is simple to use.</p>
<p>Oh, and it is free:</p>
