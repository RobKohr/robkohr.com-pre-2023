                                    <h1>How to evenly split a bill with a lot of people frequently</h1>
                    <p>The situation:</p>
<p>Every day many of your co-workers go to lunch together. Sometimes it is just a couple of them, sometimes it is up to 10.</p>
<p>No one ever has exact change</p>
<p>Splitting the bill is a 15 minute affair with fudging in various directions. Usually the waiter gets a nice bonus from all this.</p>
<p><img height="150" src="http://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2007/11/07/keyboard_dice.jpg"/>Solution:</p>
<p>Randomly pick (phone to randomize, dice, whatever) a person to pay the full bill for lunch. On a long enough timeline this creates an even distribution of payments for all people, but also the excitement of everyone frequently being a winner (not having to pay for lunch).</p>
<p>Limitations:</p>
<p>This only works if the typical behavior is to evenly split the bill. If people usually pay more or less based on what they order this won&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>It is also likely on a long enough timeline that streaks will happen (one person having to pay multiple times in a row&hellip; aka bad luck). This could be limited by a rule that no person can be hit more than two times in a row.</p>
